## Frontend APIs Project
The main focus of mine in this project is APIs. In this web you will find four
different APIs with a lot of information. The purpose of making this web is to 
show my clients that I am a well experience in integrating/using APIs. The project 
is awesome & beautiful lets explore Each API which I used in this project.

### Pexels API
This free API gives you control to use free photos & videos. This API contains lot
of features. Everyday new photos & videos are uploaded & you can access thesse by using
their (PEXEL) API. I used only photos & its info feature in this project. Initially when
you open this API in my web you will see different photos with photographer details & web
links. These photos changes automatically weak by weak or day by day. The other features 
which I included in my project is search option, with the help of search option you can 
find any photo easily.

### Spoonacular Food API
This is a food API which contains bundle of info about foods. This API gives you more 
features than other. As a free user to this API I used some of main features in this 
API due to some limitation.
In this API I used three main features:
1) Whenever you open this api , 12 random recipes each contain lots of information will 
show up.
2) On clicking any recipe it will leads you to full docs of its recipe i.e summary of 
recipe , nutrition , gradient etc of the recipe.
3) Search option , With search you can find any recipe with whole info.

### Github API 
This API is specially for Github users. With the help of this API you can access
Github control to manage your data & files etc. With security purpose I only used
this API for public use. 
The main feature I used you can access any github public data by typing its name in search bar.
